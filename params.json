{"name":"Pi of things","tagline":"A C# Framework to help build interesting IoT projects using the Raspberry Pi","body":"### Welcome to the Pi of Things\r\nPi of things is a framework (under development) that aims to provide useful APIs to do fun IoT projects using the Raspberry Pi. It is written in C# and uses Mono on the Raspberry Pi. The core library itself is called PiOfThings as well at the moment. So we can expect various other supporting libraries to be formed around it.\r\n\r\n### The GPIO Manager\r\nThe GPIOManager wraps the functionality of communicating with the GPIO ports on a Raspberry Pi 2 (and Raspberry Pi 1, B+). It provides useful APIs to communicate with the GPIO using the FileSystem.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe PiOfThings project was originally created by @sumitkm and Raj Paka as a part of their experiments with Raspberry Pi. It is now spun off as a separate library.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
